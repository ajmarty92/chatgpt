# ChatGPT-Bypass

**Author: Jose Rivas (Aka. BlackSkull)**

This code is a simple Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate text based on a user-provided prompt. The script takes in a prompt as a command-line argument using the argparse module, and prompts the user to enter their OpenAI API key. It then sends a request to the OpenAI API using the provided prompt, API key, and other parameters such as the GPT-3 model, maximum number of tokens, and temperature. The response is then extracted from the JSON-formatted API response, and the generated text is printed to the console along with the original prompt that was used. The script can be used to quickly generate text for a wide variety of applications, such as scripts, exploits, content generation, and more, without any restriction by ChatGPT, like the usual message of "As an AI language model, I cannot create or share exploits or any malicious code. It is important to note that exploiting vulnerabilities without permission is illegal and can result in severe legal consequences...", from now forget that message, with this program you would be able to request anything.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackskull0101/ChatGPT-Bypass.git
```

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.

3. Create a virtual environment for the project (optional, but recommended). You can create a virtual environment with the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```
This will create a new virtual environment in a directory called env.

4. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

5. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Run the script by running the following command:
```bash
python3 ChatGTP-Bypass.py "Enter your prompt here"
```
Replace "Enter your prompt here" with your actual prompt that you want to generate text from.

7. The script will prompt you to enter your OpenAI API key. Enter your key and press Enter.

8. The script will then generate text based on your prompt and print the generated text to the console.

9. After you are done using the script, deactivate the virtual environment by running the following command:
```bash
deactivate
```

Enjoi it!!!!!
